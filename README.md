## **Overview**

This repository demonstrates a **DevSecOps** pipeline that shifts security left by embedding security checks directly into the CI/CD process. It is designed as a learning and project-ready template for building secure, automated delivery workflows on modern infrastructure.

---

## **Architecture**

The pipeline follows a modular, stage-based architecture integrating build, test, security, image scanning, and deployment.

| **Component**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source Control**  | GitHub repository used as the single source of truth for application and IaC.  |
| **CI/CD Orchestrator** | Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate builds, tests, and deployments.       |
| **Security Tools**  | SAST, dependency scanning, and container image scanning integrated in pipeline. |
| **Artifact Storage**| Artifact/Container registry (e.g., Nexus, Docker Hub, ECR).                    |
| **Runtime**         | Containerized app deployed to Kubernetes or virtual machines.                  |

---

## **Features**

- Automated **CI/CD** with build, test, and deployment stages.
- Integrated static code analysis and dependency vulnerability scanning.
- Container image build and vulnerability scanning before deployment.
- Environment-based deployments (dev/stage/prod) with security gates.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins and/or GitHub Actions
- **Security & Quality:** SonarQube, Trivy, OWASP Dependency-Check
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes or VM-based deployment

---

## **Pipeline Stages**

A typical pipeline flow implemented in this project is:

1. **Code Checkout**  
   Pipeline fetches code from GitHub repository.

2. **Build & Unit Test**  
   Application is built and unit tests are executed; pipeline fails fast on errors.

3. **Static Code Analysis (SAST)**  
   Code is scanned for bugs, code smells, and security issues using tools like SonarQube.

4. **Dependency & Image Scanning**  
   Trivy or OWASP Dependency-Check scans dependencies and Docker images for known vulnerabilities.

5. **Artifact Packaging & Publishing**  
   Build artifacts or images are stored in a registry such as Nexus or Docker Hub.

6. **Deployment**  
   Application is deployed to Kubernetes cluster or target servers after passing all checks.

7. **Monitoring & Notifications**  
   Pipeline and application health monitored; notifications sent on failures or critical events.

## **AI Usage Report**

This project leverages **AI tools strategically** throughout its development lifecycle. Understanding the strengths of different AI models enabled me to select the right tool for each specific task, optimizing both productivity and output quality.

### **AI Tools Involved**

| **AI Tool**   | **Primary Use Case**                          | **Why This Tool?**                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Perplexity**| Research, architecture design, best practices | Real-time web search capabilities provide up-to-date DevSecOps patterns, tool comparisons, and industry standards. |
| **Claude**    | Debugging, code review, configuration fixes   | Superior code understanding and context retention make it ideal for analyzing complex error logs and multi-file configurations. |

### **Strategic AI Usage**

#### **Phase 1: Project Formation & Research (Perplexity)**

Perplexity was strategically chosen for the initial research phase due to its ability to search and synthesize current information from multiple sources:

- **Architecture Research:** Explored modern DevSecOps pipeline architectures, comparing Jenkins vs GitHub Actions workflows.
- **Tool Selection:** Researched and compared security scanning tools (SonarQube vs CodeQL, Trivy vs Grype) to identify best-fit solutions.
- **Best Practices:** Gathered industry standards for CI/CD security gates, deployment strategies, and container security hardening.
- **Documentation Structure:** Analyzed well-documented DevSecOps repositories to design comprehensive README structure.

**Key Insight:** Perplexity's real-time search provided access to latest 2024-2025 DevSecOps trends and tool updates, ensuring the project follows current industry standards rather than outdated practices.

#### **Phase 2: Implementation & Error Resolution (Claude)**

Claude was selected for development and debugging due to its strong reasoning capabilities and ability to handle complex technical contexts:

- **Configuration Debugging:** Fixed syntax errors in Jenkinsfile, GitHub Actions YAML, and Docker Compose files.
- **Pipeline Failures:** Analyzed multi-stage pipeline logs to identify root causes of build, test, and deployment failures.
- **Script Optimization:** Refined Bash scripts for security scanning integration and automated deployment.
- **Error Pattern Recognition:** Identified recurring configuration issues and suggested preventive patterns.

**Key Insight:** Claude excels at understanding the relationships between different configuration files (Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, K8s manifests) and providing context-aware solutions that consider the entire project structure.

### **AI Tool Selection Rationale**

| **Task Type**                  | **Selected Tool** | **Reason**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Current trends & comparisons   | Perplexity        | Real-time web access ensures latest information and tool updates.         |
| Complex debugging              | Claude            | Deep code comprehension and multi-file context tracking.                  |
| Architecture decisions         | Perplexity        | Aggregates multiple expert opinions and real-world implementations.       |
| Code refactoring               | Claude            | Strong reasoning for optimization and maintaining code consistency.       |
| Documentation writing          | Claude            | Better at maintaining consistent tone and technical accuracy.             |

### **Human Oversight & Final Implementation**

While AI tools accelerated research and debugging, all final decisions were made through:

- **Manual testing and validation** of each pipeline stage
- **Security review** of suggested configurations
- **Performance optimization** based on actual deployment metrics
- **Custom modifications** to fit specific project requirements

**Important Note:** AI suggestions were treated as starting points, not final solutions. Each recommendation was evaluated, tested, and adapted to ensure security, reliability, and alignment with project goals.
